## Project Description

I've created a news aggregator that not only contains generated articles, but user submitted ones as well. The final project form will allow users to create, edit, and delete articles of their choosing.

This app features `newsapi`, that claims to "contain access to over 30,000 different sources." Saves me the pain of connecting multiple news apis. For a list of the APIs used, please scroll down.

A problem I've had with some news websites is that for every thirty-odd results or so, you have to click the "Next" button. While this might be seen as a minor complaint, for me it ruins the flow of the website experience.

Finally, I named the site "Spark Lines." As in, a "headline that sparks your interest." I thought it sounded simple but memorable.


### MVP
- Ability to sort results in ascending/descending order
- Fine-tuning the CSS
